          Herman Charles Bosman (5 February 1905 – 14 October 1951) is widely
          regarded as South Africa's greatest short-story writer. He studied the
          works of Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain and developed a style
          emphasizing the use of satire. His English-language works utilize
          primarily Afrikaner characters and highlight the many contradictions
          in Afrikaner society during the first half of the twentieth century.
        </p>

        <p>Here is a short story from the master himself:</p>

        <h2>IN THE WITHAAK'S SHADE</h2>
        <p>
          Leopards? – Oom Schalk Lourens said – Oh, yes, there are two varieties
          on this side of the Limpopo. The chief difference between them is that
          the one kind of leopard has got a few more spots on it than the other
          kind. But when you meet a leopard in the veld, unexpectedly, you
          seldom trouble to count his spots to find out which kind he belongs
          to. That is unnecessary. Because, whatever kind of leopard it is that
          you come across in this way, you only do one kind of running. And that
          is the fastest kind.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remember the occasion when I came across a leopard unexpectedly, and
          to this day I cannot tell you how many spots he had, even though I had
          all the time I needed for studying him. It happened at about midday,
          when I was out on the far end of my farm, behind a koppie, looking for
          some strayed cattle. I thought the cattle might be there because it is
          shady under those withaak trees, and there is soft grass that is very
          pleasant to sit on. After I had looked for the cattle for about an
          hour in this manner, sitting up against a tree-trunk, it occurred to
          me that I could look for them just as well, or perhaps even better, if
          I lay down flat. For even a child knows that cattle aren’t so small
          that you have to stand on stilts or something to see them properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I lay on my back, with my hat tilted over my face, and my legs
          crossed, and when I closed my eyes slightly the tip of my boot,
          sticking up into the air, looked just like the peak of Abjaterskop.
          Overhead a lonely aasvoël wheeled, circling slowly round and round
          without flapping his wings, and I knew that not even a calf could pass
          in any part of the sky between the tip of my toe and that aasvoël
          without my observing it immediately. What was more, I could go on
          lying there under the withaak looking for the cattle like that all
          day, if necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          The more I screwed up my eyes and gazed at the toe of my boot, the
          more it looked like Abjaterskop. By and by it seemed that it actually
          was Abjaterskop, and I could see the stones on top of it, and the
          bushes trying to grow up its sides, and in my ears there was a far-off
          humming sound, like bees in an orchard on a still day. As I have said,
          it was very pleasant.</p>
        </p>

        <p>
          Then a strange thing happened. It was as though a huge cloud, shaped
          like an animal’s head and with spots on it, had settled on top of
          Abjaterskop. It seemed so funny that I wanted to laugh. But I didn’t.
          Instead, I opened my eyes a little more and felt glad to think that I
          was only dreaming. Because otherwise I would have to believe that the
          spotted cloud on Abjaterskop was actually a leopard, and that he was
          gazing at my boot. Again I wanted to laugh. But then, suddenly, I
          knew.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I didn’t feel so glad. For it was a leopard, all right – a
          large-sized, hungry-looking leopard, and he was sniffing suspiciously
          at my feet. I was uncomfortable. I knew that nothing I could do would
          ever convince that leopard that my toe was Abjaterskop. I wanted to
          get up and run for it. But I couldn’t. My legs wouldn’t work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every big-game hunter I have come across has told me the same story
          about how, at one time or another, he has owed his escape from lions
          or other wild animals to his cunning in lying down and pretending to
          be dead, so that the beast of prey loses interest in him and walks
          off. Now as I lay there on the grass, with the leopard trying to make
          up his mind about me, I understood why, in such a situation, the
          hunter doesn’t move. It’s simply that he can’t move. That’s all. It’s
          not his cunning that keeps him down. It’s his legs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those were terrible moments. I lay very still, afraid to open my eyes
          and afraid to breathe. Sniff-sniff, the huge creature went, and his
          breath swept over my face in hot gasps. You hear of many frightening
          experiences that a man has in a lifetime. I have also been in quite a
          few perilous situations. But if you want something to make you
          suddenly old and to turn your hair white in a few moments, there is
          nothing to beat a leopard – especially when he is standing over you,
          with his jaws at your throat, trying to find a good place to bite.
        </p>

        <p>
          The leopard gave a deep growl, stepped right over my body, knocked off
          my hat, and growled again. I opened my eyes and saw the animal moving
          away clumsily. But my relief didn’t last long. The leopard didn’t move
          far. Instead, he turned over and lay down next to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes, there on the grass, in the shade of the withaak, the leopard and
          I lay down together. The leopard lay half curled up, like a dog, and
          whenever I tried to move away, he grunted. I am sure that in the whole
          history of the Groot Marico there have never been two stranger
          companions engaged in the thankless task of looking for strayed
          cattle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next day, in Fanie Snyman’s voorkamer, which was used as a post
          office, I told my story to the farmers of the neighbourhood, while
          they were drinking coffee and waiting for the motor-lorry from
          Zeerust.
          At first people jested about this leopard. They said it wasn’t a real
          leopard, but a spotted animal that had walked away out of Schalk
          Lourens’s dream, and the upshot of this whole affair was that I too
          began to have doubts about the existence of the leopard.
        </p>

        <p>
          But when, a few days later, a huge leopard was seen from the roadside
          near the poort, and then again by Mtosas on the way to Nietverdiend,
          and again in the turf-lands near the Malopo, matters took a different
          turn. And when his spoor was found at several waterholes, people had
          no further doubt about the leopard. It was dangerous to walk about in
          the veld, they said.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exciting times followed. There was a great deal of shooting at the
          leopard and a great deal of running away from him. The amount of
          Martini and Mauser fire I heard in the krantzes reminded me of nothing
          so much as the First Boer War. And the amount of running away reminded
          me of nothing so much as the Second Boer War.
        </p>

        <p>
          But always the leopard escaped unharmed. Somehow, I felt sorry for
          him. The way he had first sniffed at me and then lain down beside me
          that day under the withaak was a strange thing I couldn’t understand.
          I thought of the Bible, where it is written that the lion shall lie
          down with the lamb.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also wondered whether I hadn’t dreamt it all. The manner in which
          these things had befallen me was unearthly, and the leopard began to
          take up a lot of my thoughts. Also, there was no man I could talk to
          about it who would be able to help me in any way. Even now, as I’m
          telling you this story, I’m expecting you to wink at me like Krisjan
          Lemmer did. (You know that kind of wink. It was to let me know that
          there was now a new understanding between us, and that we could speak
          in future as one Marico liar to another.)
          Still, I can only tell you the things that happened as I saw them, and
          what the rest was about only Africa knows.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was some time before I again walked along the path that leads
          through the bush to where the withaaks are. But I didn’t lie down on
          the grass again. Because when I reached the place, I found that the
          leopard had got there before me. He was lying on the same spot, half
          curled up in the withaak’s shade, and his forepaws were folded as a
          dog’s are sometimes. But he lay very still. And even from the distance
          where I stood I could see the red splash on his breast where a Mauser
          bullet had gone.
